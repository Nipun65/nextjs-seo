      'Steve Carell had a daunting task when he signed on to star in the American version of The Office, since his British counterpoint Ricky Gervais had created such an indelible character in David Brent. But Carell not only matched his predecessor, he exceeded him, taking the template of a comically inept boss and infusing him with a poignant fragility. Yes, Michael was often painfully naïve and childishly thoughtless, but his bottomless need to be loved humanized him. Even when he went way too far, we couldn’t stay mad at him. Carell’s performance is one of the finest in the history of TV comedy — yet he somehow never won an Emmy, which still boggles our minds — and made Michael not only the best Office character, but one of the best TV characters ever, period. Yes, that’s what we said.',

      'Too low for the male half of one of TV’s best couples ever? We like us some Big Tuna, but let’s be real: He was kind of a jerk to Dwight (and even to Pam in the later years), and he never really grew up or evolved much as a character. Still the best reaction shot in the game, though.',

      'Like every great TV character, Dwight feels completely familiar and yet utterly unique: that humorless pest of a co-worker we’ve all had at one point, turned up to 11. Rainn Wilson crafted a marvel of nerd-rage intensity, making Dwight the perfect target for Jim’s juvenile pranks. Still, in his passionate love for Angela, his endless devotion to Michael and his surprising affection for Pam, Dwight proved he wasn’t such a weirdo after all. ',

      'The icy, uptight head of accounting played by Angela Kinsey was a very specific brand of killjoy: lover of cats, enemy of fun. She didn’t laugh much, but we laughed a whole lot watching her — Kinsey could sell a joke with just a withering stare or a crook of her eyebrow — and her passionate affair with Dwight did help bring out a hint of recognizable human emotion in her… only a hint, though.',

      'Early on, Ed Helms’ dorky salesman was a great addition: a shameless suck-up with a passion for a cappella and a serious rage problem. But his appeal evaporated when he was made the boss in later seasons, and his “romance” with Erin never really worked for us. We still love you, though, Nard Dog. Don’t punch any walls.',

      'Who is Creed, really? And how did he manage to hold on to his job for so long? Dunder Mifflin’s cryptic old coot was a walking enigma, and yet never less than fascinating. It felt like the writers could add any wild anecdote to his backstory — he played in a famous rock band! He was a cult leader! He speaks Chinese! — and we’d buy it. When he was arrested in the series finale, we could only say: “Of course.”',
