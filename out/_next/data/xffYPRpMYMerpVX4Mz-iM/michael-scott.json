{"pageProps":{"character":{"name":"Michael Scott","imgUrl":"https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/office-steve-carell.jpg?w=620","path":"michael-scott","description":"Steve Carell had a daunting task when he signed on to star in the American version of The Office, since his British counterpoint Ricky Gervais had created such an indelible character in David Brent. But Carell not only matched his predecessor, he exceeded him, taking the template of a comically inept boss and infusing him with a poignant fragility. Yes, Michael was often painfully naïve and childishly thoughtless, but his bottomless need to be loved humanized him. Even when he went way too far, we couldn’t stay mad at him. Carell’s performance is one of the finest in the history of TV comedy — yet he somehow never won an Emmy, which still boggles our minds — and made Michael not only the best Office character, but one of the best TV characters ever, period. Yes, that’s what we said."}},"__N_SSG":true}
